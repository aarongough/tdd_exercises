# Test Driven Development
<br>
<span class="aside">How I stopped worrying and learned to love testing!</span>

---

### Why not test-last?
<br>
- Trains people to only test 'the happy path'
- Does not enforce high levels of test coverage
- Unexpected 'coverage holes' everywhere
- Do the tests actually fail without the feature code??

---

### TDD advantages
<br>
- Enforces high test coverage
- Better quality test cases
- Encourages modular code
- Encourages 'boy scout coding'
- Refactoring and adding features is easy and safe

### Better quality test cases?
<br>
Because you're reasoning about the expected behaviour, not the code you just wrote, TDD usually leads to:

- More complete coverage of edge cases
- More complete coverage of boundary conditions
- Less bugs
